        Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
        Thrice and once the hedge-pig whine’d.
        Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.
        Round about the cauldron go,
        In the poison'd entrails throw.
        Toad that under cold stone
        Days and nights has thirty-one
        Swelter'd venom, sleeping got,
        Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.
        Double, double toil and trouble,
        Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
        Fillet of a fenny snake,
        In the cauldron boil and bake,
        Eye of newt and toe of frog,
        Wool of bat and tongue of dog.
        Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
        Lizard's leg and owlet's wing.
        For a charm of powerful trouble,
        Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
        Double, double toil and trouble,
        Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
        Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
        Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
        Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
        Root of hemlock digg'd in dark,
        Liver of blaspheming Jew,
        Gall of goat, and slips of yew,
        Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
        Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips.
        Finger of birth-strangl’d babe,
        Ditch-deliver'd by a drab.
        Make the gruel thick and slab.
        Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
        For ingredients for our cauldron.
        Double, double toil and trouble,
        Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
        By the pricking of my thumbs,
        Something wicked this way comes.
        Open, locks, Whoever knocks!
